Problem Statement:

I have a problem with my Digital Ocean Droplet.
I followed this tutorial -> 
https://docs.librechat.ai/deployment/digitalocean.html
But it doesn't work, i have a problem with Nginx configuration. Looking at someone who can handle and make it work.
What would be the fee to look at it ?
Best

This below is Default config file i made to connect three database in digital ocean droplet and then with dns and ssl

server {
    listen 80 default_server;
    listen [::]:80 default_server;

# these below two lines are default html access file to root / if there no endpoint or frontend connected to it 
    root /var/www/html;
    index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;

    server_name sakifogpt.musicdata.studio;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }

    location /librechat-api {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3080;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }

    location /meilisearch {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:7700;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }

    location /mongodb {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:27017;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }

    # Remove the duplicate location block
    # location / {
    #     # This block handles the main domain (sakifogpt.musicdata.studio)
    #     try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    # }
}

server {
    listen [::]:443 ssl ipv6only=on; # managed by Certbot
    listen 443 ssl; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/sakifogpt.musicdata.studio/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot

    ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; # managed by Certbot

    server_name sakifogpt.musicdata.studio;

    location / {
        # This block handles the main domain (sakifogpt.musicdata.studio)
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }

    if ($host = sakifogpt.musicdata.studio) {
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    } # managed by Certbot
}


Ssl is managed and sustain by Certbox and letsencrypt
