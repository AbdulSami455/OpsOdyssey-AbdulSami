Problem Statement:

I have a problem with my Digital Ocean Droplet.
I followed this tutorial -> 
https://docs.librechat.ai/deployment/digitalocean.html
But it doesn't work, i have a problem with Nginx configuration. Looking at someone who can handle and make it work.
What would be the fee to look at it ?
