Understanding Swap: Swap is a portion of hard drive storage reserved for the operating system to temporarily store data when RAM is insufficient.

Purpose of Swap: Swap space allows the system to increase the amount of information it can hold in memory, acting as a safety net against out-of-memory errors.

Checking System for Swap Information: Commands like swapon --show and free -h help determine if there's existing swap space available.

Checking Disk Space: Utilize df -h to ensure adequate disk space for creating a swap file.

Creating a Swap File: Use fallocate to create a swap file of desired size (typically equal to or double the amount of RAM).

Enabling the Swap File: Set appropriate permissions with chmod, mark the file as swap space using mkswap, and enable it with swapon.

Making Swap File Permanent: Add the swap file information to /etc/fstab to retain swap settings after reboot.

Tuning Swap Settings: Adjusting swappiness and cache pressure settings can optimize system performance.

Swappiness: Controls how often the system swaps data out of RAM to the swap space, with values ranging from 0 to 100.

Cache Pressure Setting: Determines how much the system will prioritize caching inode and dentry information over other data, affecting filesystem performance.
